## AI Applications on MIC-AI: Advantech Edge AI and More

The MIC-AI Product Series is designed to support a wide range of AI applications, making it easier to deploy and optimize models at the edge. To help users get started, the [Advantech Edge AI](https://github.com/advantech-EdgeAI/) provides several production-ready applications that can be readily installed and used.

### Deploying DeepSeek

DeepSeek is a powerful AI model that can be installed and deployed on MIC-AI devices. Follow the steps below to set up DeepSeek on your MIC-AI system:

1. Make NVIDIA's Jetson apt source available
   ```sh
   gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-l4t-apt-source.list
   ```
   Uncomment the lines as the following:
   ```sh
   deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/common r36.3 main
   deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/t234 r36.3 main
   deb https://repo.download.nvidia.com/jetson/ffmpeg r36.3 main
   ```
2. Manually install cuda, tensorrt, opencv, and Docker
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nvidia-l4t-dla-compiler
   sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-dev nvidia-tensorrt-dev nvidia-vpi-dev nvidia-opencv-dev nvidia-cudnn-dev tensorrt
   sudo apt-get install apt-utils
   sudo curl https://get.docker.com | sh && sudo systemctl --now enable docker
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```
   If Docker cannot start up successfully due to network/firewall issues, please try to configure the firewall setting to legacy:
   ```sh
   sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
   sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
   ```
3. Install Ollama and run deepseek-r1
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh > install.sh
   sudo sh install.sh
   ollama â€“version
   export OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434
   ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b
   ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b --keepalive 1h --verbose
   ```
